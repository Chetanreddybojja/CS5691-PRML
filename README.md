- Implemented several models like Bayesian classifier (with bias-variance analysis), Linear regression, Ridge regression, Logistic regression, SVM, GMM, Decision Tree, Random forest, AdaBoost from scratch for classification on multiple datasets.
- Built prediction models like Random Forest, AdaBoost which predict the hotel rating-scores that customers will likely assign to the hotel bookings.
- The given real-world dataset is cleaned and useful features were extracted for training the model to accurately predict the hotel ratings.
